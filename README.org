#+STARTUP: overview

This is my forth iteration of my Emacs config. This time I've taken a more ~modular~ approach.

* The What
[[ttps://github.com/Drakx/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs/.emacs.d][This version]] of my config was and still is fine, I really wanted a more 'slimmed' down version, so, gone is LSP, hello eglot, gone is Ivy and Councel. Hello Vertico, Orderless, Marginalia, Consult and Embark.

* The Why
For this version I've decided that its time I learned vanilla Emacs key binds, however, evil is still included, just not enabled. With this in mind, I also decided its time to start using built in features of Emacs 29, like Eglot.
